# Pendulum Lab

## The lab objective was to the approximated period of oscillation for different amplitudes. These values were compared to an actual period of oscillation which was measured by a photogate with a real pendulum.

This project contains 3 parts.

1. Theory & Equations

2. Procedure & Experiment

3. Data results & Analysis

This lab was done using R. I collected the actual data through experiment. I then defined a function based on the equations and achieved the theoretical value for the experiment. I then compared the theoretical value with the experiment value and made an analysis on the error percentage.
